📊 Diagnosing Declining Sales in a Retail E‑Commerce Company

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes historical e‑commerce sales data to identify the causes of declining revenue and provide actionable, data‑driven recommendations to restore profitability and support long‑term growth.

The analysis was conducted as part of the Sales Intelligence Division and is intended to support decision‑making by the Head of Sales, Chief Revenue Officer (CRO), and Executive Management Team.

The company has been in operation for five years, and recent trends indicate declining performance despite continued operations.

🎯 Objectives

The key objectives of this project are to:
	•	Identify when and where revenue decline began across years, regions, channels, and product categories
	•	Detect key sources of revenue leakage such as excessive discounts and product returns
	•	Analyze customer behavior, retention, and cohort performance
	•	Provide practical recommendations to improve profitability, optimize discount strategy, and increase customer retention

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical e‑commerce transaction data including:
	•	Order dates and shipment details
	•	Customer IDs
	•	Product categories and items
	•	Sales channels (Online vs In‑Store)
	•	Regions and countries
	•	Gross revenue, discounts, net revenue
	•	Return flags and refund values

Data was analyzed using Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, and Dashboards).

🛠 Tools & Technologies
	•	Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Dashboards)
	•	Google Sheets (initial exploration and data validation)
	•	PowerPoint (Executive presentation deck)
	•	GitHub (Project documentation and version control)

📊 Key Analyses Performed

1️⃣ Revenue Trend Analysis
	•	Five‑year revenue trend analysis by month and year
	•	Identification of peak and decline periods
	•	Comparison of net revenue against discount levels

2️⃣ Regional & Channel Performance
	•	Revenue trends by region
	•	Identification of Germany as the earliest and steepest decline
	•	Channel comparison showing Online sales driving most of the decline

3️⃣ Revenue Leakage Analysis
	•	Return rate analysis by product category
	•	Discount trend analysis and margin impact
	•	Identification of high‑leakage categories (e.g., Toys, Gifts)

4️⃣ Product & Customer Insights
	•	Top and bottom performing product categories
	•	Customer purchase behavior and retention patterns
	•	Impact of repeat customers vs one‑time buyers

📈 Key Insights
	•	Revenue decline began earlier in specific regions, particularly Germany
	•	The Online channel contributed the majority of revenue loss
	•	High return rates (~26%) significantly reduced net revenue
	•	Increasing discount levels eroded profitability without driving sustainable growth
	•	Customer retention weakened during decline periods

✅ Recommendations
	•	Reduce return rates through improved product quality, descriptions, and logistics
	•	Optimize discount strategy by limiting blanket promotions
	•	Focus retention strategies on high‑value and repeat customers
	•	Reinvest in underperforming regions with targeted recovery strategies
	•	Monitor revenue leakage metrics as part of ongoing sales intelligence
